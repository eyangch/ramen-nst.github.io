# The Ramen NST (Number Sense Trainer)

## What is this?
This is a project that I ([Warith](https://warithr621.github.io)) started to help students practice for Number Sense competitions, from local elementary competitions to the ultimate HS state competition.

## What is Number Sense?
Number Sense is a competition developed by the University Interscholastic League (UIL) to test students on their mental math. Students are given a 10-minute time limit to answer as many of 80 problems as possible, under the following scoring conditions:
- +5 points for every correct answer
- -4 points for every wrong answer
- -4 points for every question skipped
- Questions after the last attempted question are not penalized

## Isn't that pretty difficult given the timing?
Yes, yes it is. However, many tricks have been developed to turn basic arithmetic that may take 30 seconds mentally into a quick 5-second process. That's the purpose of this project! Using the [Bryant Heath Manual](http://bryantheath.com/files/2018/04/Heath_NSTricks_revA.pdf) as a guideline, my goal is to try to develop this open-source website as one to help students grow as much as they can in their mental math abilities.
